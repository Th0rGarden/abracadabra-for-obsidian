<h2>Supporting Developers!</h2>
<p>
One of the most important reasons this plugin exists is to make it easier for users to support plugin developers, and to lighten the load of providing support back to users.<br/><br/> Creating, maintaining, as well as addressing user questions all for free software is time consuming, and practically impossible for many. <br/><br/>This is why Abracadabra features a "Donate" button in the info card for every developer who adds their funding links in the plugin's manifest or readme files.<br/><br/> Donating to developers helps the Obsidian ecosystem thrive.<br/><br/> Every little bit helps!<br><br>

## What is Abracadabra?

Abracadabra is a **management console** that fundamentally redefines your relationship with the Obsidian plugin ecosystem.

### 😵‍💫 The Problem
The potential of many plugins is locked away behind fragmented interfaces. Documentation lives on GitHub, commands in the palette, hotkeys buried in settings. This forces constant context switching and leads to "feature blindness"—where you only use a fraction of a plugin's true power.

### 🪄 The Solution
Abracadabra consolidates this disparate information into a single, coherent interface. It **summons a dynamic command deck for each plugin**—a powerful, unified workspace that can be used inline, as a floating window, or in a dedicated pane. To fully grasp the power of this approach, explore the [**Core Concepts & Views**](https://th0rgarden.github.io/abracadabra-for-obsidian/#core-concepts) in our documentation.

<br/>

## Three Views

- <strong>Inline View:</strong> Integrates directly into any plugin's settings page.
- <strong>Pop-out Window:</strong> A floating, draggable, and resizable window for parallel work.
- <strong>Dedicated View:</strong> A full-pane/tab view you can place anywhere in your workspace.

<br/>

## Key Features: Your Modular Command Deck

Each component of the Command Deck is a powerful tool on its own. For a complete breakdown of every feature and setting, check out the full documentation.

- **🃏 Info Card**: Your mission control. Features an advanced version manager, one-click changelogs, and an intelligent action bar with auto-detected Donate, Docs, and Wiki links, plus a configurable Dev menu. ([See Docs for Details →](https://th0rgarden.github.io/abracadabra-for-obsidian/#ref-info-card))
    
- **📖 Readme Viewer**: In-app documentation with intelligent fetching, enhanced rendering for media, full-text search, and font controls. ([Details →](https://th0rgarden.github.io/abracadabra-for-obsidian/#ref-readme-viewer))
    
- **🎛️ Command Module**: Build a visual grid of buttons for any command in Obsidian. Customize names, icons (1000+), and colors. Includes one-click "Pre-populate" and "Clear" actions. ([Details →](https://th0rgarden.github.io/abracadabra-for-obsidian/#ref-command-module))
    
- **⌨️ Commands & Hotkeys List**: A complete registry of a plugin's commands. Run them directly, jump to hotkey settings, and discover integrations by showing commands from other plugins. ([Details →](https://th0rgarden.github.io/abracadabra-for-obsidian/#ref-commands-list))
    
- **📝 Plugin Notes**: A personal scratchpad for each plugin, saved as standard Markdown files in your vault. Features auto-saving and resizable height that can be remembered per-plugin. ([Details →](https://th0rgarden.github.io/abracadabra-for-obsidian/#ref-plugin-notes))
    
- **🖥️ Console Logger**: A live, in-app debugging tool. Captures and filters console messages by source plugin, with one-click copy for easy bug reporting. ([Details →](https://th0rgarden.github.io/abracadabra-for-obsidian/#ref-console-logger))

## Bonus Upgrades

Abracadabra also enhances your entire Obsidian experience. Discover all the [**Bonus Features & Universal Enhancements**](https://th0rgarden.github.io/abracadabra-for-obsidian/#bonus-features) in the full documentation.

- **🔎 Search Any Plugin's Settings:** Injects a search bar into other plugins' native settings pages (can be disabled, like most features, in settings)
    
- **🎨 Uncap Your Theme Picker:** Removes the item limit from the theme selection dropdown for the [Theme Picker plugin](https://github.com/trey-sedate/obsidian-theme-picker)
    
- **⚡Open settings for any plugin:** Adds a global command to "Open settings for another plugin...".
    
<br>

## Workflows Transformed

Here's a real-world example of how Abracadabra can change the game.

> The first thing I do when I install a new plugin now is pop open its Abracadabra window. It docks to the side of my screen, which lets me read the setup guide while I'm actually configuring the settings in the main window.
>
> Once I have a basic understanding, I'll scan the commands and hotkeys list. This is where I see what the plugin *really* does. I can run commands directly from the list to test them out before I commit to a hotkey.
>
> After I've figured out the key actions I'll be using regularly, I build out a custom command module. I'll add things like 'Archive Tasks' and 'Task Report' and give them custom icons and colors. With this I get a visual app that's tailored to my specific needs. And of course, the info card is great for keeping things up to date; I don't have auto-update plugins enabled in Obsidian because I like to control which versions I install. But sometimes if I see a new beta is available, I'll click the release notes button to see what's new, and I can update with one click.

- **Q: The "Update" button failed. What do I do?**
    
    - **A:** This is usually a network issue or GitHub rate limit. The best fix is to add a [GitHub Personal Access Token](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https://github.com/settings/tokens/new?scopes=repo&description=Obsidian%20Plugin%20Abracadabra) in Abracadabra's "Data Management" settings.

- **Q: How do I reset the layout for just one plugin?**
    
    - **A:** Go to that plugin's settings, click the Abracadabra ˅ control menu, and select "Reset Plugin Layout". [Our Customization Guide explains this in more detail](https://th0rgarden.github.io/abracadabra-for-obsidian/#customization).
